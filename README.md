#The Ouroboros Language 
A custom Haskell based compiler for a simple imperative language called 'Ouroboros' designed to deal with multiple Streams of Integers at the same time. The compiler used Alex and Happy for lex and parse the input. The language supports Integers, Booleans, Streams and Streams within Streams as its data structures. It provides machnisms for variable storage, reading from files, writing to files, inexing, length operations, looping, concatenation, basic numerical and boolean operations.

The language was created for Programming Language Concpets at Southamton University. For more information see the 'Ouroboros Language Report' pdf included in the repo.
